# GreenChainz Revit Plugin - Icon Resources

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Revit ribbon:

## Required Files

1. **icon_16.png** - 16x16 pixel PNG icon (small button icon)
2. **icon_32.png** - 32x32 pixel PNG icon (large button icon)

## Icon Guidelines

- Use PNG format with transparency
- Design with the GreenChainz brand colors
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Suggested: leaf/sustainability themed icon

## Temporary Workaround

Until proper icons are created, the plugin will run without icons (buttons will have text only).

To create placeholder icons, you can use any image editor to create:
- A simple green circle or leaf shape
- Save as PNG with the exact filenames above
