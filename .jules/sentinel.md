## 2025-02-17 - Web Security Headers
**Vulnerability:** Missing HTTP security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) in the Next.js web application.
**Learning:** Next.js requires manual configuration in `next.config.ts` to add these headers globally.
**Prevention:** Always verify security headers are configured in the framework's config file during project setup.
